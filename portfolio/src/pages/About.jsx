        <p>
            I am a full stack web developer currently finishing my certificate at UPenn. I have experience with HTML, CSS, JavaScript, React, Node.js, Express, MongoDB, MySQL, and Git.
            My background is in sales and project management and I currently run and manage a warehouse for a mid-sized roofing company. I have a bachelor's degree in professional studies from West Chester University, and I served in the United States Marine Corps with a combat deployment to Iraq. I am a problem solver, team player, and hard worker always looking forward to the next task. 
        </p>
        <p>
            I am currently looking for a part time postion or paid internship to continue learning and growing as a developer. I am also open to full time positions if the right opportunity presents itself.
        </p>
        <p>
            When I am not working, coding, or studying, I enjoy spending time with my wife and son, playing video games, and watching our Eagles Fly!
